<h3>AngularJS Services</h3>
<p>In AngularJS you can make your own service, or use one of the many built-in services.</p>
<h3>What is a Service?</h3>
<p>In AngularJS, a service is a function, or object, that is available for, and limited to, your AngularJS application.
<br>
AngularJS has about 30 built-in services. One of them is the $location service.
<br>
The $location service has methods which return information about the location of the current web page:</p>

<h4>URL:</h4>
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="customersCtrl">
<p>{{myUrl}}</p>
</div>
  
</body>
<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('customersCtrl', function($scope, $location) {
    $scope.myUrl = $location.absUrl();
});
</script>
</html>
