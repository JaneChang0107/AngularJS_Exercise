    <h4>Know Your Scope</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is important to know which scope you are dealing with, at any time.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the two examples above there is only one scope, so knowing your scope
        is not an issue, but for larger applications there can be sections in
        the HTML DOM which can only access certain scopes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When dealing with the <b>ng-repeat</b> directive, each repetition has
      access to the current repetition object:
    </p>

    <div
      ng-app="myApp"
      ng-controller="myCtrl"
      style="background-color: honeydew"
    >
      <ul>
        <li ng-repeat="x in names">{{x}}</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      in this case a string, which is referred to by using <b>x</b>. Each
      <b><li></li></b> element has access to the current repetition object,
    </p>
  </body>
  <script>
    var app = angular.module("myApp", []);

    app.controller("myCtrl", function ($scope) {
      $scope.names = ["Emil", "Tobias", "Linus"];
    });
  </script>
</html>
